# Binary Exploitation

## format string 0

**Approach: Brute Force**

Initially, I tried to brute force the challenge and was successful. I found the flag quickly and easily and then analyzed the given code afterwards.

The brute-force method allowed me to navigate through the challenge effectively. By testing the inputs given in the program, I successfully retrieved the flag. 
 
For `Patrick`, I started with the burger names from the menu. I noticed that the system accepted the input `Gr%114d_Cheese`, which triggered a format string vulnerability.

For `Sponge Bob`, the second customer, I continued with the same method, testing all the provided burger names, the input `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` was accepted, which also exhibited format string behavior.
Thus, I received the flag.

**Knowledge Gained:**

Format Strings- Learnt how format strings can be used to manipulate the output. The %s and other format specifiers can be exploited to read from the stack.
