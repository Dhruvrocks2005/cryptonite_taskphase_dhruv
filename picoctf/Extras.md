## what's a net cat?

```
Description
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 25103 to get the flag?
```
- `nc` is the command for `netcat`, a tool that can read and write data across network connections.
- `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org` is the serverâ€™s domain.
- `25103` is the port to connect to on that server.
```

```

Each chr(0x..) converts a hexadecimal ASCII code into a character.

Approach: Just executed the file and followed the instructions

Gave myself (user/owner/root) permission to execute the file using chmod command leanrt in task phase 1 

```

```

**Knowledge Gained:** Using tabcomplete in the Terminal 

## strings it

In this challenge, we were given a binary file that contains the flag. We needed to extract this flag by analyzing the strings in the file.

**Approach:**

I ran the `strings` command on the given file, redirecting the output to a file named `olaola`. This step captured all readable strings in the file.
Finally, I used `grep` to search for the flag format, `picoCTF`, within `olaola`.

```
root@DhruvsPC:~# touch olaola
root@DhruvsPC:~# strings strings > olaola
root@DhruvsPC:~# grep 'picoCTF' olaola
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_7f766a23}
```

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_7f766a23}
```

**Knowledge Gained:**

`strings` command extracts readable ASCII characters from binary files, which can reveal hidden information like flags.

## First Grep

We can grep the flag from the file using the default flag format, as intended, OR we could just use ctrl+f in the file (opened in a text editor)'

```
root@DhruvsPC:~# grep 'picoCTF' file
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
```

## Python Wrangling

```
Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... 
Can you run this Python script (ende.py) using this password (6008014f6008014f6008014f6008014f) to get the flag (flag.txt.en) ?
```

```

**Knowledge Gained:** Learnt how to run python scripts on the terminal

# Binary Exploitation

## heap 0

**Approach: Exploit heap overflow vulnerability**

We need to modify `safe_var` to a value other than `"bico"` so that the `check_win()` function will print the flag.

Since both `input_data` and `safe_var` are allocated close to each other on the heap, if we overflow `input_data`, it will spill over into `safe_var`, allowing us to modify its contents.

```
Welcome to heap0!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x62ca8e36f2b0  ->   pico

[*]   0x62ca8e36f2d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 2

# Forensics

## Secret of the Polyglot

I opened the given PDF file and found half of the flag there.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf495ad8-4523-469f-b7e2-f72206b27548)

```
1n_pn9_&_pdf_724b1287}
```

The given second part of the flag hints that the first part is related to PNG.

When I opened the given file in a text editor, I found out that it has elements of both a pdf and a png.

Then I opened the file in a hex editor, identified the PNG signature (starting with 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A and ending with 49 45 4E 44 AE 42 60 82), and isolated the PNG data from the rest of the PDF content.

The PNG contained the first half of the flag:

![hello](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3273e2cf-38c6-41b2-abf4-acdc02d23981)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/617b13eb-dd1d-4f69-beb2-88aabd012402)

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_724b1287}
```

## Scan Surprise

![flag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1077a5c8-9b8b-434f-bf16-955f38484720)

**Approach: Used Google Lens to scan the qr and found the flag.**

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{p33k_@_b00_a81f0a35}
```
## Verify

**Approach: Ran the decrypt script for all the files using a simple for loop in the Linux shell**

Command used:

```
for file in files/*; do ./decrypt.sh "$file" ; done
```

```
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
checksum.txt  decrypt.sh  files
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls files

# Web Exploitation

## WebDecode

**Approach: Inspected the page and then decoded the encoded flag hidden there**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6552e059-c314-46e4-a3ab-25f6acadb724)

**Encoded Flag:**

```

```

The encoded string is in Base64 format. Decoding it reveals the flag.

## Mod 26

ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter 13 positions in the alphabet. Applying ROT13 again on the encoded text will return the original text.

There were no instances of `J`, `Z`, `X` or `Q` in the decrypted paragraph so the flag could be calculated with permutation and combination but even that was not required since it was obvious which character('Q') would be used as the flag is in leetspeak.

## keygenme-py

The flag is `picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_xxxxxxxx}` where `xxxxxxxx` is the dynamic part that changes based on the username `SCHOFIELD`.

The dynamic part of the flag is derived from the username SCHOFIELD by hashing it with SHA-256 and extracting specific characters from the hash.

The code specifically grabs the following characters from the SHA-256 hash: hash[4], hash[5], hash[3, ]hash[6], hash[2], hash[7], hash[1], hash[8].

Calculating the dynamic part of the flag:

## Safe Opener

Program:
```
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;  
public class SafeOpener {
    public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader keyboard = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        Base64.Encoder encoder = Base64.getEncoder();
        String encodedkey = "";
        String key = "";
        int i = 0;
        boolean isOpen;
        

        while (i < 3) {
            System.out.print("Enter password for the safe: ");
            key = keyboard.readLine();

            encodedkey = encoder.encodeToString(key.getBytes());
            System.out.println(encodedkey);
              
            isOpen = openSafe(encodedkey);
            if (!isOpen) {
                System.out.println("You have  " + (2 - i) + " attempt(s) left");
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    
    public static boolean openSafe(String password) {
        String encodedkey = "cGwzYXMzX2wzdF9tM18xbnQwX3RoM19zYWYz";
        
        if (password.equals(encodedkey)) {
            System.out.println("Sesame open");
            return true;
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Password is incorrect\n");
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

According to the program, the encoded key is `cGwzYXMzX2wzdF9tM18xbnQwX3RoM19zYWYz`, which is encoded in Base64.
