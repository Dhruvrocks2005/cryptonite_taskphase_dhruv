# Web Exploitation - Mandatory Challenges

## cookies

```
Description
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/
```

**Approach:**

The challenge description suggested experimenting with cookies, specifically, the `name` cookie's value. I started by exploring the site to understand how it handled cookies.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15592894-8d32-4f7c-9751-e72b03b21198)

Entering common cookie names in the search bar on the main page resulted in the `name` cookie's value changing from `-1` to values like `0`, `1`, etc.

I entered `snickerdoodle` as input which changed `name` cookie's value to 0:

When I changed `name` cookie's value to 1:

`That is a cookie! Not very special though...` message was coming till `name` = 28

To expedite the process, I wrote a Python script using the `requests` library to incrementally set the "name" cookie value and checked for the flag.

**Script:**

```
import requests

# URL for the check page
url = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check"

# Start value for the "name" cookie
cookie_value = 0

while True:
    # Set the cookie with the current value
    cookies = {'name': str(cookie_value)}
    
    # Make a GET request with the cookie set
    response = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
    
    # Check if the flag or unique message is found in the response
    if "picoCTF{" in response.text:
        print("Flag found!")
        print(response.text)
        break
    else:
        print(f"Tried cookie 'name={cookie_value}', no flag found.")
    
    # Increment the cookie value
    cookie_value += 1
```

**Output:**

By running the script, I observed that the flag was found at `name = 18`

When I changed `name` cookie's value to 18:

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}
```

**Incorrect Tangents:**

Initially, I manually entered different values for the `name` cookie but realized that it was too inefficient. This led me to try a script to systematically check the response at different values of the `name` cookie, which ultimately gave me the flag quickly and easily.

# Web Exploitation - Extra Challenges

## WebDecode

**Approach: Inspected the page and then decoded the encoded flag hidden there**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6552e059-c314-46e4-a3ab-25f6acadb724)

**Encoded Flag:**

```
cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9
```

The encoded string is in Base64 format. Decoding it reveals the flag.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce77c7f2-98ee-4eaf-8ec1-1c9ee08f6504)

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_02cdcb59}
```

## Unminify

**Approach: Found the flag upon inspecting the page**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36e85b58-e2a6-4930-bd50-43304840dc57)

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_b99eb82e}
```

## Insp3ct0r

**Approach: I just inspected the page and found the flag divided into 3 parts, hidden in the `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS (JavaScript)`
source codes of the webpage**

`HTML`, `CSS`, `JS (JavaScript)`

```
Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 
```

```
You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c93905e-0f3c-4b18-b3a2-bedd17e1ce62)

```
Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?832b0699}
```

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}
```

## where are the robots

**Approach:** I knew about robots.txt from OASIS CTF so this was very straightforward

## Power Cookie

**Approach: Modifying cookies**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28ae55da-72e1-4954-9822-3c20cc31200e)

I clicked continue as guest and a cookie named isAdmin with value 0 was generated.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfe3f28e-120f-430c-bff8-ba2e14454be1)

I edited the cookie value to 1.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b22140-1b06-45eb-9077-ffa287613a5b)

I received the flag upon refreshing the page.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7264b34-d467-49fc-82d6-b640da713074)

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{gr4d3_A_c00k13_65fd1e1a}
```
