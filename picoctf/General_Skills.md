## what's a net cat?

```
Description
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 25103 to get the flag?
```
- `nc` is the command for `netcat`, a tool that can read and write data across network connections.
- `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org` is the serverâ€™s domain.
- `25103` is the port to connect to on that server.
```

```

Each chr(0x..) converts a hexadecimal ASCII code into a character.

**Flag:**

```

**Knowledge Gained:** Using tabcomplete in the Terminal 

## strings it

In this challenge, we were given a binary file that contains the flag. We needed to extract this flag by analyzing the strings in the file.

**Approach:**

I ran the `strings` command on the given file, redirecting the output to a file named `olaola`. This step captured all readable strings in the file.
Finally, I used `grep` to search for the flag format, `picoCTF`, within `olaola`.

```
root@DhruvsPC:~# touch olaola
root@DhruvsPC:~# strings strings > olaola
root@DhruvsPC:~# grep 'picoCTF' olaola
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_7f766a23}
```

**Flag:**

```
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_7f766a23}
```

**Knowledge Gained:**

`strings` command extracts readable ASCII characters from binary files, which can reveal hidden information like flags.

## First Grep

We can grep the flag from the file using the default flag format, as intended, OR we could just use ctrl+f in the file (opened in a text editor)'

```
root@DhruvsPC:~# grep 'picoCTF' file
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
```

## Python Wrangling

```

Can you run this Python script (ende.py) using this password (6008014f6008014f6008014f6008014f) to get the flag (flag.txt.en) ?
```

```

```

**Knowledge Gained:** Learnt how to run python scripts on the terminal
