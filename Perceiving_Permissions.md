# Perceiving Permissions

Ninth Module

## Changing File Ownership

In this challenge, the task was to change the ownership of the `/flag` file to the current user (`hacker`), and then read its contents.

- I executed the following command to change the ownership of `/flag` to the `hacker` user:
   ```
   chown hacker /flag
   ```

- After changing the ownership, I used the `cat` command to read the contents of the `/flag` file:
   ```
   cat /flag
   ```

Flag:
```

```

## Groups and Files
In this challenge, the task was to change the group ownership of the '/flag' file, making it accessible to the 'hacker' user group, and then read its contents.

   - I used the `chgrp` command to change the group ownership of the `/flag` file to `hacker`:
     
     ```
     chgrp hacker /flag
     ```
   - After changing the group, I used the `cat` command to read the flag:
     
     ```
     cat /flag
     ```

Flag:
```

```

## Fun With Groups Names

In this challenge, the task was to change the group ownership of the `/flag` file using a randomized group name assigned to my user and then read the flag.

   - I used the `id` command to find the group name associated with my user:

      ```
     id
     ```
   - After identifying the group (`grp16382`), I used the `chgrp` command to change the group ownership of the `/flag` file:
     
     ```
     chgrp grp16382 /flag
     ```
   - Finally, I used the `cat` command to read the flag:
     
     ```
     cat /flag
     ```

Flag:
```
pwn.college{c3hl_YBHwNVXXY-GAlf7ibOihTr.dJzNyUDLwQDN1czW}
```

## Changing Permissions

In this challenge, the task was to modify the permissions of the `/flag` file to make it readable, despite being owned by `root`.

   - I used the `chmod` command to add read permissions for others (i.e., users who are not the owner or in the group):
     
     ```
     chmod o+r /flag
     ```
   - After modifying the permissions, I used the `cat` command to read the flag:
     
     ```
     cat /flag
     ```

Flag:
```
pwn.college{wkkeNjaRJiKhhxCluszLRZjGTZH.dNzNyUDLwQDN1czW}
```

## Executable Files

In this challenge, the task was to make the `/challenge/run` program executable and run it to retrieve the flag.

   - Initially, I used the `chmod` command to add execute permissions for others (`o+x`), but the permission was still denied:

      ```
     chmod o+x /challenge/run
     /challenge/run
     ```
   - Upon reviewing the fileâ€™s permissions, I noticed that the `hacker` user lacked execute access (I was the owner this time and did not fall into the others category), so I added execute permissions for the user (`u+x`):
     
     ```
     chmod u+x /challenge/run
     ```
   - After making the file executable, I successfully ran the program and retrieved the flag:
     
     ```
     /challenge/run
     ```

Flag:
```

## Permission Tweaking Practice

In this challenge, the task was to correctly modify the permissions of the `/challenge/pwn` file through eight rounds, following the specified permission requirements for each round. After successfully completing all rounds, I gained permission to modify the `/flag` file and read the flag.

- **Round 0:**
   - Needed permissions: `rwxr-xr-x`
   - Command used: 
     ```
     chmod ugo+x /challenge/pwn
     ```

**Final Step:**

After successfully completing all rounds, I was given permission to modify the `/flag` file:
   - Command used:
     ```
     chmod u+r /flag
     ```

   - Then I used the `cat` command to read the flag:
     ```
     cat /flag
     ```

Flag:

  - Needed permissions: `r-xrwxrw-`
    
  - I set the permissions using:
    
    ```
    chmod u=rx,g=rwx,o=rw /challenge/pwn

---

**Final Step:**
- The ownership of the `/flag` file was changed, and its current permissions were `---------`. I set it to be readable by the user:
  
  ```
  chmod u=r /flag
  ```
- I then read the flag:
  
  ```
  cat /flag
  ```

Flag:
```

## The SUID Bit

In this challenge, the task was to add the SUID (Set User ID) bit to the `/challenge/getroot` program, allowing it to run with root privileges so that I could read the flag.

   - I first checked the permissions of the `/challenge/getroot` program:
     
     ```
     ls -l /challenge/getroot
     ```
   - I then added the SUID bit using the `chmod` command:
     
     ```
     chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
     ```
   - After setting the SUID bit, I confirmed the change:
     
     ```
     ls -l /challenge/getroot
     ```
   - Finally, I executed the program to gain a root shell:
     
     ```
     /challenge/getroot
     ```
   - In the root shell, I used the `cat` command to read the flag:
     
     ```
     cat /flag
     ```

Flag:
```
